# Progress Log

## Current Verified State

- Repository root: `E:/HESD/my-harness`
- Standard startup path:
  - Windows: `.\harness\init.ps1`
  - POSIX: `bash harness/init.sh`
- Standard verification path: run the startup path and any workflow-specific
  evidence listed in `harness/features.json`.
- Active feature: none. `MH-001 Create v0.1 continuity package` is passing.
- Current blockers: none recorded.

## Best Next Step

Run the remaining v0.1 acceptance tests:

1. Cold start.
2. Tiny documentation edit.
3. High-risk request simulation.
